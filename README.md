# **PriceOracle – An LLM-powered Pricing Recommendation System**

### 📌 Description

PriceOracle is an **NLP-driven system** that transforms raw pricing data into **accurate, explainable recommendations**.
It combines:

* **Semantic Retrieval** → retrieves relevant records from millions of rows.
* **Test-Time Scaling (TTS)** → generates multiple candidate answers with diverse strategies.
* **Test-Time Reranking (TTR)** → selects the most reliable answer using reranking and constraints.

Users can query in **natural language** (e.g., *“lowest price in May 2023”*) and get:

* The **best answer** (price, currency, date, origin).
* **Evidence snippets** from the data source.
* **Transparent reasoning** behind the recommendation.

⚡ In short: **PriceOracle = LLM-powered smart engine for pricing queries with evidence.**
